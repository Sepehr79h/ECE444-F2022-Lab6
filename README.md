**Pros and Cons of TD**

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming practice that instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed.
Although it has many advantageous and imperative impacts on the development on a project, there also some downsides attributed to TDD. 


Firstly, there are many pros in using TDD. For example, TDD forces the team to automate the testing process. This is important 
in large systems where multiple different functionalities are required to be tested. Additionally, TDD gives a higher degree of 
confidence at the time of deployment. It also helps ensure that the testing process is not rushed, and thus lead to a better quality of 
products created. Finally, TDD fits well in the Agile Methodology, partly due to its automated nature and the pros mentioned above. 

On the other hand, there are also some downsides attributed to TDD. Firstly, unit testing is not a complete measure of correctness, but
rather a measure of predictive behaviour. So although unit tests guarantee that our code behaves as we expected it to, the expected 
behavior might be incorrect, incomplete or functional only on happy flow. Also, in some cases more test code is written than implementation
code, making it hard to manage, especially when tests are too large or the team forgets to run tests frequently.
